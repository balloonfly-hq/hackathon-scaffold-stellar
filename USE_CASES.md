   - 🔴 **Red**: 10.00x+ (rare)
4. Clicks any multiplier
5. Modal opens with round details

```mermaid

    style D fill:#a855f7
    style L fill:#8b5cf6
```

**Success Criteria:**

- ✅ History visible and updated
- ✅ Color-coding correct
- ✅ Details accessible

---

### UC-07: Verify Provably Fair Result

**Actor:** Skeptical Player

**Preconditions:**

- Round has ended

**Flow:**

1. Player clicks "🔒 Provably Fair" button
2. Modal shows:
   - Server seed hash (pre-published)
   - Revealed server seed (after crash)
   - Client seeds (from first 3 bets)
   - Combined hash
   - Crash multiplier calculation
3. Player can verify independently:
   ```javascript
   hash = SHA256(serverSeed + clientSeed1 + clientSeed2 + clientSeed3);
   multiplier = calculateFromHash(hash);
   ```
4. Player confirms calculation matches
1. Player clicks round details or inspects `RoundDetailsModal`
2. Modal shows the on-chain recorded round data:
   - **Server Seed Hash**: The 32-byte SHA256 commitment published prior to betting
   - **Client Seeds**: Entropy contributed by players during the betting window
   - **Result**: The deterministic crash multiplier recorded on-chain
   - **Round Stats**: Total bets and total XLM wagered
3. Player confirms cryptographic commitment:
   - The contract verifies `SHA256(server_seed) == server_seed_hash` when starting the round, binding the operator before client seeds are gathered.
   - **Note on Revealed Seed**: In the current contract version (`contracts/balloonfly`), `server_seed_hash` is permanently recorded in contract storage, but the raw `server_seed` preimage is verified and discarded during `start_round` without being written to contract storage. Full client-side re-derivation requires the operator to publish the raw seed off-chain, or for a future contract upgrade to store `server_seed` in `Round` upon `finalize_round`.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram

    participant UI

- Bob cashes out at 3.00x → Wins 145.50 XLM ✅
- Charlie doesn't cash out → Loses 100 XLM ❌

### Scenario B: Bet During Flight

**Setup:**

- Round started, multiplier at 1.80x
- Player tries to place bet

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor Player
    participant Game
    participant Contract
    participant Queue

    Note over Game: Round Flying (1.80x)
    Player->>Game: Click "Place Bet"
    Game->>Contract: Try place_bet()
    Contract->>Contract: Check round status
    Contract->>Game: Status: Flying
    Game->>Queue: Queue bet for next round
    Queue->>Player: Toast: "Bet placed for next round"

    Note over Game: Current round continues
    Note over Queue: Bet waiting...

    Game->>Game: Round ends
    Game->>Game: New round starts
    Queue->>Contract: Process queued bet
    Contract->>Player: Bet now active!
```

**Outcome:**

- Bet rejected for current round
- Bet queued for next round
- Toast message: "Bet placed for next round"

### Scenario C: Network Disconnect

**Setup:**

    participant Contract

    Player->>Contract: Place bet (10 XLM)
    Note over Contract: Bet stored on-chain
    Contract->>Frontend: Bet confirmed
    Frontend->>Player: Show active bet

    Note over Network: Connection lost! 📡❌
    Frontend->>Frontend: Offline mode

    Contract->>Contract: Process results

    Note over Network: Connection restored! 📡✅
    Player->>Frontend: Reconnect
    Frontend->>Contract: Fetch latest state
    Contract->>Frontend: Round ended, your bet lost
    Frontend->>Player: Show results

    Note over Player: Can see what happened!
```

**Outcome:**

- Bet still valid on-chain
- Player can reconnect and continue
- If crashed, result visible after reconnect

## 📊 Statistics Tracking

The frontend provides aggregated performance metrics via `StatisticsPanel` across selectable timeframes (**Today**, **7D**, **15D**, **30D**). The displayed metrics match the four cards rendered by the panel:

1. **Paid**: Total amount of XLM won and paid out across ended rounds within the selected window (`sum(total_payout)`).
2. **RTP (Return to Player %)**: Aggregate return percentage computed across ended rounds using the formula `(paid / total_bet_amount) * 100` (or `0` when no bets exist).
3. **Players**: An estimated activity metric (`Math.max(filteredRounds.length * 5, sum(bet_count))`). As noted in the codebase, this is an estimate/placeholder pending a dedicated backend indexer for unique address queries.
4. **Online Now**: A real-time concurrent user indicator currently rendered with placeholder value `0` pending WebSocket or presence event infrastructure.

> **Note on Per-Player Metrics**: Individual player tracking (such as personal win rate %, average cash-out multiplier, personal biggest win, or cumulative player profit/loss) requires wallet-level bet indexing that the smart contract does not currently expose directly. These metrics will be enabled once the backend indexing service is deployed.
Players can track:

- Total bets placed
- Win rate (%)
- Average cash-out multiplier
- Biggest win
- Total profit/loss
- Rounds played

## 🔐 Security Use Cases

### SEC-01: Prevent Double Cash-Out

**Attack:** Player tries to cash out twice

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor Attacker
    participant Frontend
    participant Contract

    Attacker->>Frontend: Click "Cash Out" (1st)
    Frontend->>Contract: cash_out(bet_id)
    Contract->>Contract: Check bet status: Active
    Contract->>Contract: Mark as cashed out
    Contract->>Attacker: Payout sent ✅

    Attacker->>Frontend: Click "Cash Out" (2nd) 🚨
    Frontend->>Contract: cash_out(bet_id)
    Contract->>Contract: Check bet status: Already cashed
    Contract->>Attacker: Error: Bet already settled ❌

    Note over Contract: State prevents double spend
```

**Prevention:**

- On-chain state checked
- First cash-out invalidates bet
- Second attempt rejected

### SEC-02: Verify Fair Crash

**Scenario:** Player audits game fairness

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Before Round] --> B[Server publishes hash]
    B --> C[Players see hash]
    C --> D[Round starts]
    D --> E[Players bet + provide seeds]
    E --> F[Round crashes]
    F --> G[Server reveals seed]
    G --> H{Verify}

    H -->|Step 1| I[SHA256 revealed == published hash?]
    I -->|Yes ✅| J[Step 2: Combine seeds]
    J --> K[hash = SHA256 server + client1 + client2 + client3]
    K --> L[Step 3: Calculate multiplier from hash]
    L --> M{Matches crash?}
    M -->|Yes ✅| N[Game is FAIR! 🎉]
    M -->|No ❌| O[Report fraud! 🚨]

    I -->|No ❌| O

    style N fill:#10b981
    style O fill:#ef4444
```

**Solution:**

1. Get server seed hash (before round)
2. Round completes
3. Server seed revealed
4. Verify: `SHA256(revealed) === hash`
5. Calculate multiplier from seeds
6. Confirm crash was predetermined
    A[Before Round] --> B[Server commits server_seed_hash]
    B --> C[Players observe committed hash on-chain]
    C --> D[Players bet and contribute client seeds]
    D --> E[Contract verifies SHA256 server_seed == hash on start]
    E --> F[Round crashes at deterministic multiplier]
    F --> G[On-chain state stores hash, client seeds, multiplier]
    G --> H{Audit}
    H -->|Commitment Enforced| I[Operator cannot alter outcome after bets ✅]
    H -->|Seed Preimage| J[Retained off-chain by operator / future contract upgrade]

    style I fill:#10b981
    style J fill:#f59e0b
```

**Verification Details:**

1. **Pre-Bet Commitment**: Server publishes `server_seed_hash` before any bets are placed or client seeds are received.
2. **Contract Enforced Check**: When `start_round` is called, the contract computes `SHA256(server_seed)` and requires it to equal `server_seed_hash`.
3. **Entropy Injected**: Player-submitted client seeds are bound to the round state on-chain.
4. **Preimage Storage Status**: Currently, `Round` in the contract stores `server_seed_hash: BytesN<32>` and `client_seeds: Vec<BytesN<32>>`, but does not store the raw `server_seed` preimage on-chain. Independent zero-knowledge recalculation of the crash formula requires the operator to reveal the preimage off-chain (or a future contract upgrade to persist `server_seed` in `Round` on `finalize_round`).
